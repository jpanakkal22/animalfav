        <p id="para1">Dogs are considered "Man's Best Friend" for a very good reason.
            I have personally owned a dog for over 11 years, and to say 
            that she has been a "best friend" is an understatement.

            Dogs are a member of the genus, <i>Canus</i> or what we consider Canines, and 
        closely resemble wolves. What makes them wonderful pets are their behaviors,
        physical traits and senses that we as humans find useful to our lives.

            Many owners like myself look to dogs for personal protection because of 
            their barking, hearing, sense of smell and ability to be trained to obey 
            commands. Not only these, but most dogs have a loving and pleasing nature
            that makes them a great fit amongst other animals as additions to family 
            households.
